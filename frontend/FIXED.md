# âœ… FIXED: react-native-svg Installed

## What Happened

The error was clear: `react-native-svg` was in `package.json` but not installed.

## âœ… Fixed

1. âœ… Installed `react-native-svg@13.9.0`
2. âœ… Recreated `expo-env.d.ts` file

## ðŸš€ Now Restart Expo

```bash
cd frontend
npx expo start --clear
```

This should work now! The Metro bundler should be able to find all dependencies.

## âœ… What to Expect

- Metro bundler starts successfully
- No more "dependency not installed" errors
- Bundle compiles correctly
- App loads in browser/Expo Go

## ðŸ“‹ If Still Having Issues

1. **Check terminal output** - Look for any other errors
2. **Clear cache**: `npx expo start --clear`
3. **Check TypeScript errors**: `npm run type-check`

Everything should be working now! ðŸŽ‰
